PPW is a parallel port wrapper written in C for accesing low level functions (such as ioctl) from C# easily.

It's compiled into the shared library libppw.so.

It's not intended to be used directly by end-users. It is, instead, referenced by the Pigmeo Framework.

End-users should use managed libraries provided by the Pigmeo Framework instead.
